INTRODUCTION

Hello, all! I manage one of the teams that handles the consumer facing website for Vivid Seats. I’ve created a Manager’s README so you can get to know a little more about me, my team, how we work together, and my expectations.

MY ROLE

My role consists of five main components: creating an environment where team members can be productive, recruiting excellent new team members, ensuring team processes are smooth and efficient, leading the strategy of ongoing projects, and meeting organizational goals through team initiatives. Summarily, I’m here to help you be successful in your career and to help my team be successful in the organization.

MY LEADERSHIP STYLE

I value transparency, autonomy, and bi-directional feedback in a team. I expect each member of my team to communicate effectively, own their work, and give and receive feedback when necessary.

COMMUNICATION

Communication is the foundation of a team. It is your responsibility to inform your manager and your team of your schedule and availability, the status of ongoing development work or production support issues, or any other information that is necessary for the team to work efficiently and meet its goals.

Use Slack to notify the team and stakeholders of non-urgent matters or to announce updates to a larger audience, such as all of engineering. The Slack team channel is generally used to notify the team if you’re working from home or if you have a doctor's appointment during the day. It’s also the place to track the status of development work, for example, posting a link to the pull request when a story is ready for development review. I recommend using Slack personal messages only if you have a private matter to discuss. If the information would be useful to others, please post the message in the team channel so others can benefit from the discussion. You may also communicate with stakeholders via personal messages to notify them of the status of projects that they are involved.

Agile meetings are the place to update the team on the status of ongoing development work in the sprint. During Stand up, each team member of the team has an opportunity to discuss items including but not limited to: tasks they worked on yesterday, tasks they plan on working on today, pairing opportunities on the story they’re working on, any relevant ongoing production support issues, planned releases for the day, the results of any ongoing A/B tests, and the status of retrospective items from the previous sprint. During the Retrospective that occurs at the end of each sprint, you’ll have the opportunity to point out challenges and areas of improvement for the team and determine next steps for those items. Retro is also a time to celebrate team wins, such as a successful launch of an A/B test.

You can use the shared team calendar to communicate your PTO days or time out of the office with the team, and the email to chat with third parties if their integration is related to a production support issue.

Last but not least, feel free to chat with me face to face regarding any of the topics listed above as well as urgent matters that require immediate attention, such as a production support issue.

DEVELOPMENT & TEAM WORKFLOW

Paired programming isn’t required on my team, but I certainly encourage collaborating with the team while you code. When working on larger, more involved stories and tasks, it’s helpful to bounce ideas off your team members to determine an optimized solution. Paired programming is especially useful during the on-boarding process regardless of whether you’re an intern or a lead engineer. Actively coding with others generates a discussion surrounding both coding best practices and the learning the application’s architecture. Sharing and reviewing this information as we work is beneficial for all levels of engineers when new to the team.

The acceptance criteria of a story will ideally be determined prior to beginning work on the story. Unless a stakeholder requires a change that’s crucial to the story, you shouldn’t grow or change the AC during the story’s development. If you see an area of improvement that’s a candidate for refactoring while working on the story, write a new story to implement those changes. The team can then thoughtfully and collaboratively workshop the story to ensure we take the proper approach when making large code changes. In order to iterate quickly, we need to keep stories as small, bite-sized chunks, so we can meet deadlines and stakeholder expectations and reduce the risk of creating bugs in production.

I value ownership and transparency in my team members. You are responsible for your work and for communicating your code changes with the team. That’s not to say the rest of the team isn’t there to help during the development process. Take ownership of your work and drive conversations with others during development review and verification so that the team can collaborate with you on tasks during development and provide helpful feedback before the new code is released.

Code quality is critical for a team’s flexibility and ability to work quickly. Ensure all new code is clean, reusable, and testable. If it’s not possible within the scope of a story, create a new story that rethinks the current approach and architecture.

Be prepared for both meetings you lead and meetings you attend. An unnecessary, one hour, weekly meeting for a team for 5 developers wastes 20 developer hours per month and 240 developer hours per year, which is a substantial amount of development work. Meetings to facilitate team communication and plan projects are necessary to a team’s success, but poorly planned, badly thought out meetings are frustrating for everyone.

Focus on critical thinking. It’s natural to want to express your grievances when challenges arise, but also take it upon yourself to solve those problems with your team. Don’t be the teammate that complains without putting in the effort to find a solution. Viewing challenges as an opportunity to showcase your skills will help you grow as a leader on your team.

1:1’s

1:1’s are for you. I’m here to support you and your career growth. I recommend you drive a prepared agenda for these meetings. 1:1’s aren’t meant to be a status meeting on ongoing sprint items, but rather a conversation about items such as removing any blockers at work, setting technical and professional goals, reviewing topics during the on-boarding process, and giving feedback. I will regularly point out ways you’re doing well and provide constructive feedback on things I think you could improve. I expect you to also provide feedback for me if there’s something you’d like me to work on.

A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ME

I’m naturally an introvert. I like to listen to everyone’s ideas and opinions before I give mine.
I am extremely goal oriented. I write down personal goals for one month, six month, and five year intervals.
I’m more productive when I focus on one thing at a time. I take lots of notes so I can circle back to other items when I have time to focus on them.
Highly visible and impactful UI projects are my favorite. I recently enjoyed coordinating cross-team efforts to implement and A/B test new venue seat maps with row level data.
I find ill-defined projects incredibly frustrating. They often waste substantial developer time and pose a tremendous risk for code quality.
I have a sweet, loving, but also overly emotional and troublesome orange tabby cat. I love sharing and receiving cat pictures with coworkers.
TLDR
It’s my job to help you and the team perform its best.
It’s your responsibility to communicate with you team in a timely manner about any pertinent information that will affect the team and its output.
Collaborate with your teammates during development, use best practices while coding, and think outside the box when facing challenges.
Be prepared for 1:1’s so we can create goals and ensure you succeed in your career.
